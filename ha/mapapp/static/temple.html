        <p>There is also an Amman Temple nearby my neighbourhood. Nestled amidst a cluster of trees and modest homes, the Amman temple stands as a vibrant and sacred space, radiating spiritual energy and local tradition. Its colorful gopuram, adorned with intricate carvings of deities and mythological figures, rises proudly against the sky, guiding devotees to its gates.
